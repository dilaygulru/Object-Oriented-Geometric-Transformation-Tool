### Overview

This C# application is designed for geometric transformations and visualizations. It incorporates object-oriented principles to model two-dimensional geometrical shapes and provides a graphical user interface for interactive manipulation.

### Features

***Point2D Class:*** Handles the representation of 2D points with methods to print coordinates, calculate polar coordinates, and convert back to Cartesian coordinates.

***Polygon Class:*** Represents a polygon with methods to calculate vertices based on a central point and edge length, and rotate the polygon.

***Graphical User Interface:*** Allows users to input parameters for the polygon (center, length, number of edges, rotation angle) and visually display the polygon within a designated drawing area.

***Interactive Controls:*** Users can draw the initial shape, apply rotations, and randomize parameters through the interface, with results displayed graphically and as lists of coordinates.


### Usage

***Setting Parameters:*** Enter the values for the center, length, and number of edges of the polygon using the provided text boxes.

***Drawing the Polygon:*** Click the designated button to draw the polygon based on the entered parameters.

***Rotating the Polygon:*** Input the desired rotation angle and use the rotation button to apply it.

***Randomization:*** Use the randomize button to fill all input fields with random values within specified ranges.

### Installation
